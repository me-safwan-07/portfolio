summary: "Deep clone your local data safely without corrupting the original using a simple NPM package."

## The Problem: Local Changes, Global Mess

These only perform **shallow copies** â€” they don't help if your object has nested fields, arrays, or deeply nested structures.

> One small update in the nested data, and ðŸ’¥ â€” the original object gets affected too.

---

## What is @ungap/structured-clone?

A tiny NPM package â€” a **polyfill** for the modern `structuredClone()` Web API (not available in all Node.js versions).

It supports **deep cloning** of:

- Objects  
- Arrays  
- Maps & Sets  
- Dates  
- Deeply nested values  

It's like pressing **"duplicate everything safely"** for any JavaScript value.

## How I Used It

### Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @ungap/structured-clone
```

### Usage

```js
import structuredClone from '@ungap/structured-clone';

const originalData = await getDataFromDatabase();

const localCopy = structuredClone(originalData);

// Make local changes safely
localCopy.status = "Published";
localCopy.updatedAt = new Date();

// Save only after confirming
await saveToDatabase(localCopy);
```

âœ… Simple  
âœ… Safe  
âœ… No accidental data mutations  

---

## Why I Loved It

Key benefits:

* âœ… Prevents unwanted mutations
* âœ… Peace of mind while editing deeply nested data
* âœ… Ideal for form editing, drafts, or local state management

---

## When Should You Use This?

Perfect for apps with:

* Temporary form states
* Undo/redo functionality
* Draft and review flows
* User edits before confirming

---

## Bonus: Works Great with React

If you're using **React or MERN stack**, `structuredClone` is amazing for local state management:

* Works inside **reducers** or **contexts**
* Ensures no mutation of the original object
* Clean debugging and rollback handling

---

## Final Thoughts

Sometimes the **smallest packages solve the biggest frustrations**.

`@ungap/structured-clone` gave me confidence to work with complex data structures without the fear of unintended side effects.

If you're still deep-cloning manually with JSON hacks or lodash tricks â€” give this a try.
