## How I Started Learning to Code

When I was in college, I came across someone‚Äôs portfolio website. I was impressed and decided I wanted to create my own portfolio. So, I turned to Google to find out how to make one.

Google suggested I should learn `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. I remembered that I had learned the basics of `HTML` back in 12th grade, so I felt confident to start.

## Taking the First Steps

On **January 1, 2024**, I set a goal: _2024 would be my year to learn web development_.

I began with HTML and CSS using:

- The **Mimo app**
- **W3Schools**

For JavaScript, I followed the **Namaste JavaScript** playlist on YouTube.

## Facing Challenges and Overcoming Them

I created an Instagram profile and tried building my first website. But I ran into difficulty understanding CSS layout concepts like `Flexbox` and `Grid`.

To fix this, I played the **Flexbox Froggy** game ‚Äî it was fun and interactive.  
_**Now, I‚Äôm confident with Flexbox!**_

## Building My Online Presence

I created accounts named **CodeWithSafwan** on:

- **Instagram**
- **GitHub**

I made small projects and uploaded them to GitHub. I also started posting my progress using Instagram Reels.  
However, I had to pause due to semester exams.

Timeline:

- **April to June**: Backend fundamentals  
- **July to August**: Learned `React.js`  
- **September to October**: Learned `React Native`

## Working on Big Projects

Currently, I‚Äôm working on two **major projects** that are taking a lot of time and effort.

üóìÔ∏è As of **July 2, 2024**, I‚Äôm fully committed to completing both by **December**.
